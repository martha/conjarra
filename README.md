# conjarra

[Conjarra](https://conjarra.herokuapp.com/) is a quick conjugation quiz app I threw together, using Fred Jehle's awesome [database](https://github.com/ghidinelli/fred-jehle-spanish-verbs) of Spanish verbs and conjugations.

## todo
- server fetch and cache verb data while waiting for user answers
- could actually do the whole 9 yards js lint thing
- landing page loading bar (sangr√≠a?)
- favicon
- hover for english
- timer clock
- point system, more weight to irregular verbs
